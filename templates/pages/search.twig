    <p>These diverse types of interlinked, nonlinearly accessed media forms are called <strong><em>hypermedia</em></strong><em>.</em> As software architect Irakli Nadareishvili <a href="http://www.freshblurbs.com/blog/2013/12/03/web-hypermedia-apis-node.html">explains</a>, &ldquo;Hypermedia is the matter of which the World Wide Web is made. Much like the physical world is built of interacting elementary particles (Bosons and Fermions), the web is essentially a universe of myriad interacting hypermedia documents.&rdquo; The more common term <em>hypertext</em> is closely related to hypermedia, with the bulk of the Web consisting of webpages primarily written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a>. But <em>hypermedia </em>transcends hypertext, the word suggesting that more than just text is capable of being hyperlinked, such as graphics, videos, and music files.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In essence, then, hypermedia is just another name for everything that we see, hear, and interact with on the Web. But since the early 1990s, the general concept of hypermedia has been largely superseded in popular usage by the term &ldquo;interactive multimedia.&rdquo; It is primarily only in the world of software engineering and architecture that people continue to speak of hypermedia. And these days, the term is most often used in the context of developing Web-based Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs.</p>
    <p>As the complexity of software applications and systems continues to grow, there&rsquo;s an increasing need for different components within a single application&mdash;and for entirely separate applications&mdash;to be able to communicate with each other simply and clearly. This cross-linguistic data-exchange is what APIs have always been used for, but the variety of APIs and the languages used to code them can vary as widely and be as idiosyncratic as individual software applications themselves. An API developed by Facebook and an API developed by Twitter may not communicate nicely with each other, and developers usually have to sort through any given API&rsquo;s unique documentation to figure out how to use it with their own application. Many system engineers and software developers believe their jobs would be far simpler if there existed a common format for writing APIs, following a shared, agreed-upon structure. And they look to the Web as a proven example of such a possibility.</p>
    <p>The Web is a system of hyperlinked hypermedia that, despite the endless varieties of software languages that are used to construct its websites and media types, generally manages to stay remarkably interconnected and communicate clearly between its many constituent parts. A single hyperlink, clicked within a Web browser, can serve up a YouTube video just as easily as it can display a BuzzFeed text-and-gif listicle. This has led a number of thoughtful software architects to furrow their brows and wonder if there isn&rsquo;t a better way to go about creating APIs. Why not focus our efforts on designing <strong><em>hypermedia APIs</em></strong><em>, </em>they ask, that can be just as simple and universally understood as the Web&rsquo;s hyperlinks are by virtue of using the inherent power of hyperlinks themselves?</p>
